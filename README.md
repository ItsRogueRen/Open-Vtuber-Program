# Open-Vtuber-Program
An open-source Vtuber application for Linux, Windows, and MacOS

This program is current in very early development and merely a proof of concept at the moment. Included is the Unity project and a build for Linux x86_64

There are things still needed to improve this project! If you want to help, I'm looking for the following:
- Lipsync libraries that are compatible with Linux, MacOS, and Windows
- A way to build a MacOS version without an Apple device
- A way to improve eye tracking (OpenSeeFace makes eyes closed when not looking directly at the camera)
- Any custom C# code you think will help improve the application!

I'm currently taking C# classes to write some code that will allow uploading your own model to the built application, but if someone has already found a way to do this feel free to save me the time!
